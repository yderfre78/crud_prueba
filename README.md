# CRUD:  Agenda de contactos

To simulate the consumption of services from the backend, we use json server Fake Rest Api
[Json Server Rest Api](http://https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server "Json Server Rest Api")
In the terminal we execute the script:
### `npm run fake-api`

In the package.json file, there is the following script, run the database on port: 5000 local host


     "fake-api": "json-server --watch src/api/db.json --port 5000"`



In the following youtube video the operation of the application is explained:
